 1. Database Setup
 Create a database with two primary tables: contacts and messages. Schema is provided.
 Structure the messages table to store messages associated with the contacts.
 2. Data Generation
 Populate the database with 100,000 dummy contacts and 5 million messages randomly
 distributed among the contacts. For the messages, please incorporate the data in
 ‘message_content.csv’ (about 180k rows).
 Download ‘message_content.csv’ here:

 You can then generate dummy messages to produce a total of at least 5 million rows by
 using the message content within the csv
